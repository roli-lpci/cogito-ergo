# fidelis

## Zero-LLM memory for Claude Code and AI agents.

**73.0% end-to-end QA on LongMemEval-S. 83.2% R@1 retrieval. $0/query. No LLM in the default retrieval path.**

Stop re-explaining context to your agent. fidelis returns your original notes verbatim — local-first, fast, about 60 seconds to install. Your agent already calls an LLM to think; it should not need another one just to remember. Designed for developers. Built for SOC2-compliant enterprise agents.

What fidelis is:

- **fast** — ~216 ms local retrieval (full benchmark mean; vector-only path is faster)
- **cheap** — $0/query retrieval cost
- **private** — local memory store by default
- **faithful** — original stored passages returned, not paraphrases
- **proven** — benchmarked on LongMemEval-S (470 questions, public benchmark), with raw evidence in [`experiments/zeroLLM-FLAGSHIP-evidence/`](experiments/zeroLLM-FLAGSHIP-evidence/)
- **installable** — Claude Code via MCP in about 60 seconds

## Quickstart

```bash
# 0. one-time: Ollama + the local embedder (~280 MB)
brew install ollama && ollama serve &
ollama pull nomic-embed-text

# 1. install + run
pip install fidelis
fidelis init                  # background service (launchd / systemd)
fidelis watch ~/notes         # auto-ingests markdown
fidelis mcp install           # wires Claude Code
# Restart Claude Code. Memory is on.
```

Linux users swap `brew install ollama` for the equivalent install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com). [See Requirements](#requirements).

v0.0.9 — pre-release.

## What you notice immediately

After the four commands above, the next time you open Claude Code:

- It stops asking you to repeat context you already wrote down.
- You can ask "what did we decide last week about auth?" — and the answer cites your actual decision, not a generic OAuth lecture.
- Architecture rationale you wrote in a markdown file two months ago surfaces when relevant.
- Your project context carries across sessions instead of resetting at every new conversation.
- Failed migration notes, naming conventions, founder voice memos — all queryable in your agent's normal flow.

Most of fidelis's value is *not* the benchmark; it's not having to explain the same thing twice.

## Most AI memory systems rewrite your notes

Most memory systems rephrase content on the way out. The specific fact gets summarized into something general. fidelis solves this structurally — there is no LLM in the default retrieval path, so the store returns exactly what you put in.

You store:

```text
auth tokens expire after 3600 seconds.
The 3600s window is non-configurable in our current contract.
```

A lossy memory layer may return:

```text
authentication has a configurable timeout
```

fidelis returns:

```text
auth tokens expire after 3600 seconds.
The 3600s window is non-configurable in our current contract.
```

The non-configurable qualifier survives. So does every other detail you wrote down.

## What this enables in Claude Code

Once `fidelis mcp install` is run, ask your agent:

- *"What did we decide about auth?"*
- *"What failed last time we tried this migration?"*
- *"Which billing constraint was non-configurable?"*
- *"What did I say about Sarah's onboarding flow?"*

The MCP `fidelis_recall` tool fires before Claude composes its answer. Claude sees the original passages, not paraphrased summaries. The answer is grounded in what you wrote, with the qualifiers intact.

> **fidelis retrieves memory without an LLM. Your agent still uses its normal LLM to answer using the retrieved context.** "Zero-LLM" applies to the memory hot path, not to your agent.

## Use cases & ROI

Three concrete reasons teams pick fidelis over hosted memory:

- **Cost reduction.** Stop paying for redundant context-window tokens on every turn. Memory lives on disk; the agent pulls only what's relevant per query. At a few thousand calls/day the math against per-query memory APIs adds up fast.
- **Security & compliance.** Zero data egress in the default zero-LLM path simplifies SOC2 / HIPAA scoping for the agent-memory layer — your notes never leave the box, so the memory store falls outside any third-party data-processor agreement.
- **Team context.** Agents that remember historical decisions, naming conventions, failed migrations, and the *qualifiers* on those decisions. The non-configurable detail you wrote down two months ago surfaces when relevant, in the founder's voice, not paraphrased.

## How it fits

The diagram is at the top. Claude Code is the fastest path to value. The retrieval engine is agent-agnostic — pair it with any LLM client.

## Benchmarks

LongMemEval-S, 470 questions, public benchmark.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Retrieval R@1 | **83.2%** |
| Retrieval R@5 | **98.3%** |
| End-to-end QA accuracy | **73.0%**, Wilson 95% CI [68.7%, 77.0%] |
| Cost per query (retrieval) | **$0** (local) |
| Mean retrieval latency | 216 ms (zero-LLM hybrid: BM25 + dense + RRF) |

For context: published Mem0 results on LongMemEval-S are in the ~66–70% end-to-end QA range; Zep is 71.2%; Supermemory is 81.6%; full GPT-4o on raw context (no memory system) is 60.2%. fidelis reaches 73.0% with no LLM in the default retrieval path.

Raw evidence: [`bench/runs/zeroLLM-full-20260424/aggregate.json`](bench/runs/zeroLLM-full-20260424/aggregate.json) · [`experiments/zeroLLM-FLAGSHIP-evidence/SUMMARY.json`](experiments/zeroLLM-FLAGSHIP-evidence/SUMMARY.json)

The QA tier wraps your existing LLM with a 140–180-token system prompt — the Fidelis Scaffold. See [`docs/scaffold.md`](docs/scaffold.md).

## Verify the zero-LLM claim yourself

```bash
# Unset any LLM API keys for this shell
unset OPENAI_API_KEY ANTHROPIC_API_KEY DASHSCOPE_API_KEY

# Optional: drop your network. Ollama runs on 127.0.0.1:11434 (loopback).

# `recall-hybrid` is the explicit-tier command. zero_llm is the default.
fidelis recall-hybrid "what did the user say about Sarah" --tier zero_llm
tail ~/.fidelis/server.log
```

The default `zero_llm` tier never makes an outbound LLM call. Optional `--tier filter` and `--tier flagship` modes do call an LLM, but only to select integer pointers — the server dereferences those pointers to the original stored text. The LLM cannot rephrase memory content.

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux (Windows not yet supported)
- Python 3.10+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) running locally with `nomic-embed-text` pulled (~280 MB):

  ```bash
  brew install ollama && ollama serve &
  ollama pull nomic-embed-text   # ~280 MB, one-time
  ```

The full init-to-first-recall cycle is under 60 seconds once Ollama is up. No memory API keys required.

## Quick reference

```bash
fidelis recall "what did the user say about Sarah"
fidelis query  "Sarah" --limit 5
fidelis health
fidelis seed   ~/memory/   ~/notes/
```

Python helper for direct integration:

```python
from fidelis.augment import augment
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()
answer = augment(
    question="What did I say about Sarah?",
    qtype="single-session-user",
    llm_call=lambda system, user: client.messages.create(
        model="claude-haiku-4-5",  # any current Claude Messages model works
        system=system,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user}],
        max_tokens=512,
    ).content[0].text,
)
```

## What's running on your machine

After `fidelis init`:

- **Service:** `fidelis-server` runs at `http://127.0.0.1:19420` under your OS service manager (launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux). Auto-starts on boot. Logs at `~/.fidelis/server.log`.
- **Storage:** Chroma + SQLite at `~/.cogito/` (the directory name is preserved from the project's pre-rename codename for v0.0.x compatibility — it will move to `~/.fidelis/` in a later major bump). No data leaves your machine in the default zero-LLM path.
- **MCP:** if you ran `fidelis mcp install`, Claude Code sees three tools: `fidelis_recall`, `fidelis_query`, `fidelis_health`.

To stop: `fidelis init --uninstall`. To wipe: `rm -rf ~/.cogito ~/.fidelis`.

## Known limitations (v0.0.9 honest list)

- **Pre-release.** Python function names and CLI commands may change. Pin the version if you build on it.
- **Best on macOS Sequoia / Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.** Other OSes likely work but aren't gate-tested.
- **Temporal-reasoning and preference questions are the weakest qtypes** in the QA scaffold (TR ~58%, Pref ~37% on the full eval). Single-session and knowledge-update qtypes are strong (95–100%).
- **The optional LLM tier ("flagship" mode) currently escalates ~80% of queries instead of the intended ~10%** — an 8× cost miss we're transparent about. The default zero-LLM tier is unaffected.
- **qwen3.5:9b in thinking mode does not reliably follow the literal hedge instruction** in the Fidelis Scaffold. Use Claude, an OpenAI-format API, or non-thinking-mode local models for reliable hedging.

## What this turns into over time

Day 1: drop notes into `~/notes`, run the four commands.
Day 2: ask Claude Code about yesterday's decision — the answer cites your original passage.
Day 7: your agent starts carrying project context across sessions; you stop re-explaining.

Useful for solo builders today; relevant for teams that need memory to stay local tomorrow.

## fidelis for teams / enterprise
