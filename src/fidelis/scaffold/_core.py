"""Fidelis Scaffold v0.1.0 — drift-safe QA wrapper for retrieved memory.

The scaffold modifies the LLM's procedure for answering retrieval-augmented questions
WITHOUT modifying the LLM itself. It is designed to:

1. Lift accuracy on questions where extraction-only fails (TR, MS, Pref).
2. Preserve hedge ability — "I don't know" stays available when retrieval is thin.
3. Bound multi-turn linguistic drift via versioned, removable scaffold wrap.
4. Pass static validation (lintlang, scaffold-lint, custom preflight).
5. Be idempotent: wrap(wrap(x)) == wrap(x).
6. Stay below 200 input tokens at all qtypes.

Versioning: scaffold tokens are bracketed with [FIDELIS-SCAFFOLD-v0.1.0] markers so
downstream tools (driftwatch, agent-convergence-scorer) can locate and remove
scaffold contributions when measuring drift on subsequent turns.
