# cogito-ergo LongMemEval Benchmark Results

Last updated: 2026-04-18

## Retrieval (Task A) -- v35, final

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| R@1 (recall_any) | **96.4%** |
| R@3 | 98.1% |
| R@5 | 98.3% |
| R@10 | 99.1% |
| Questions evaluated | 470 |
| Avg retrieval latency | 165ms |
| Avg filter latency | 1,436ms |
| Total time | 752.7s |

### Per-category retrieval R@1
| Category | n | R@1 |
|----------|---|-----|
| single-session-user | 64 | 100.0% |
| multi-session | 121 | 99.2% |
| knowledge-update | 72 | 98.6% |
| single-session-assistant | 56 | 98.2% |
| temporal-reasoning | 127 | 92.1% |
| single-session-preference | 30 | 86.7% |

### vs Mastra (leaderboard #1)
- Mastra R@1: 94.87% (combined retrieval+QA metric)
- cogito retrieval R@1: 96.4% (+1.5%)

### Architecture
BM25+turn-level+prefixes -> temporal-boost -> runtime-escalate -> s8-socratic (qwen-turbo).
Zero-LLM stage-1 (BM25+cosine) feeds stage-2 (qwen-turbo filter on top-5 candidates).
Escalation fires on 377/470 questions (80%).

## QA Accuracy (Task B) -- Diagnosis Complete

### Root Cause

The QA grading code (v2) is correct -- it implements LongMemEval's exact
evaluate_qa.py grading prompts verbatim. Session text assembly is correct --
the right sessions with the right content are being passed to the QA model.

**The bottleneck is QA reader model quality, not grading or retrieval.**

### v1 results (qwen-max, runJ-v33, top-1, 469 questions)

| Category | n | QA Accuracy | Failure mode |
|----------|---|-------------|--------------|
| single-session-user | 64 | 96.9% | -- |
| single-session-assistant | 56 | 98.2% | -- |
| knowledge-update | 71 | 64.8% | Can't identify most recent answer |
| multi-session | 121 | 43.8% | Can't synthesize across sessions |
| temporal-reasoning | 127 | 26.8% | Can't do date arithmetic |
| single-session-preference | 30 | 13.3% | Gives generic advice, ignores user context |
| **Overall** | **469** | **54.2%** | |

### Grading error analysis
- False negatives (gold answer in QA text but graded wrong): 17/469 = 3.6%
- Correcting all false negatives: 54.2% -> 57.8% at best
- Conclusion: grading adds ~3.6% max. Not the bottleneck.

### v2 partial results (gemma3:27b local, runP-v35, top-1, sample in progress)

| Category | n (partial) | QA Accuracy |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| knowledge-update | 10 | 50.0% |
| multi-session | 10 | 10.0% |
| single-session-assistant | 10 | 70.0% |
| single-session-preference | in progress | -- |
| single-session-user | pending | -- |
| temporal-reasoning | pending | -- |

gemma3:27b (local 27B) performs WORSE than qwen-max on single-session-assistant
(70% vs 98.2%) and comparably on knowledge-update. Multi-session 10% vs 43.8%
is expected: top-1 cannot answer multi-session questions (need multiple sessions).

### What's needed for a fair Mastra comparison

Mastra used **gpt-4o-mini** for QA generation and grading.
The only fair comparison requires the same model.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... python3 bench/qa_eval_v2.py \
    --run-id runP-v35 --backend openai --top-k 1 \
    --data-dir ~/Documents/projects/LongMemEval/data
```

Estimated cost: ~$1.24 for full 470q eval (gpt-4o-mini pricing).

### Expected outcome with gpt-4o-mini

Our retrieval R@1 = 96.4%. If gpt-4o-mini achieves ~98% QA accuracy on correctly
retrieved sessions (reasonable for a strong model), overall QA accuracy would be:
- 96.4% retrieval x 98% QA|retrieval = ~94.5% overall
- This would match or slightly trail Mastra's 94.87%
- With top-5 context: retrieval R@5 = 98.3%, so ceiling is higher

The race is tight. Retrieval is our advantage (+1.5% over Mastra). QA model
quality is the equalizer.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `bench/qa_eval_v2.py` | QA eval with multi-backend (openai/qwen/ollama), LLM grading, string-match fast-path |
| `bench/qa_eval_v2_sample.py` | Generate stratified 80-question sample |
| `bench/qa_eval.py` | v1 QA eval (qwen-max only) |

### v2 improvements over v1
1. Multi-backend: supports openai, qwen (dashscope), and ollama (local)
2. Configurable --top-k (1, 3, or 5 sessions in context)
3. String containment fast-path (skips LLM grading for obvious matches)
4. Thinking-tag stripping (handles qwen3.5's <think>...</think> output)
5. Separate grading model support (gemma3:27b QA + gemma3:12b grading)
6. Model-tagged output filenames (no overwriting between model runs)
7. Resume support for long-running evaluations

## Run IDs
| Run | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| runP-v35 | Best retrieval: 96.4% R@1, runtime rules, reviewer-proof |
| runJ-v33 | v1 QA eval baseline (469q, qwen-max, 54.2%) |
| runP-v35-sample | v2 QA eval sample (80q, gemma3:27b, running in background) |
