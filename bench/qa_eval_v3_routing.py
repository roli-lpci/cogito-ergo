"""
QA accuracy evaluation v3 — qtype-aware K routing + per-qtype model routing.

Key improvements over v2:
  1. Per-qtype K routing: configurable dict — K=1 for SSU/SSA/Pref, K=5 for MS/TR, K=1 for KU
  2. Per-qtype reader model: gpt-4o for MS/TR (complex synthesis), gpt-4o-mini for SS types
  3. Enhanced synthesis prompts: explicit session-ID attribution for MS; temporal with date math
  4. Token/cost tracking per API call with running totals
  5. --qtypes filter: run only specific qtype(s) for targeted experiments
  6. Receipt JSON generated at end (cost, model, seed, command, timestamp)

Usage:
    # E0 dry-run (limit=5)
    python3 bench/qa_eval_v3_routing.py --run-id runP-v35 --limit 5

    # E1: MS-only, enhanced synthesis, gpt-4o-mini
    python3 bench/qa_eval_v3_routing.py --run-id runP-v35 --qtypes multi-session --experiment-id E1

    # E2: Full run, gpt-4o for multi-session + temporal
    python3 bench/qa_eval_v3_routing.py --run-id runP-v35 --gpt4o-for-multi --experiment-id E2
