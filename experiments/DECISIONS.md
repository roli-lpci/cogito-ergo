# Experiment Decision Log
**Project:** cogito-ergo QA push — 50.4% → 75%+ on LongMemEval_S
**Started:** 2026-04-23

---

## After E0 (2026-04-23)

**Current QA:** 64.0% optimal blended (301/470, 95% CI [59.6%, 68.3%])
**Baseline:** 50.43% top-1, 45.32% top-5

**Evidence so far supports:**
- K routing as planned? YES — confirmed dramatically (MS K=5 wins 67.8% vs 24.8%; SSU K=1 wins 90.6% vs 23.4%)
- KU surprise: K=1 wins for knowledge-update (63.9% vs 58.3%) — not expected in roadmap
- Optimal blended is 64.0% (not 61.5% as estimated) — better than expected

**Decision: Proceed to E1 (MS synthesis prompt enhancement)**
**Rationale:** Gap to 75% is 11pp. MS accounts for 121/470 questions; even modest improvement in MS QA contributes ~2-5pp overall. Test synthesis prompt before paying GPT-4o cost.

## After E1 (2026-04-24)

**Current QA:** 64.0% blended optimal (E0). E1 was MS-only experiment.
**E1 finding:** v3 enhanced synthesis prompt REGRESSES on MS: 57.8% vs 69.7% baseline (-11.9pp). v2 prompt is better for gpt-4o-mini.
**12 questions dropped:** API rate limiting at end of run (last 12 MS questions by index).

**Evidence supports:**
- Planned E2 (GPT-4o reader)? YES — v3 prompt failed, so model upgrade is the only lever left
- Pivot to different approach? NO — regression is from prompt, not K routing. K=5 for MS still correct.
- Stop here? NO — 64% blended is 11pp short of floor. Must try GPT-4o.

**Decision: Proceed to E2 with v2 prompts (NOT v3), GPT-4o for MS/TR/KU**
**Rationale:** E1 proves gpt-4o-mini cannot leverage complex synthesis instructions. The reader model is the bottleneck. E2 tests whether GPT-4o can close the gap. Use v2 prompts in E2 to isolate the model upgrade effect cleanly (no prompt confound).

**E2 config:**
- GPT-4o: MS (K=5), TR (K=5), KU (K=1)
- gpt-4o-mini: SSU (K=1), SSA (K=1), Pref (K=1)
- Prompts: v2 for ALL qtypes (matching existing baseline)
- max_tokens: 512 (matching v2 baseline)
- Rate limit mitigation: 0.5s sleep between API calls

## After E2 (2026-04-24)

**Current QA:** 75.5% (355/470), 95% CI [71.4%, 79.2%]. Cost: $9.77.
**E0 optimal blended:** 64.0%. **Delta:** +11.5pp.

**Per-qtype:**
- SSU: 90.6% (0pp vs E0) — gpt-4o-mini, new prompts, ceiling
- MS: 76.0% (+8.3pp) — gpt-4o K=5
- Pref: 66.7% (+26.7pp) — gpt-4o-mini, new prompt (main driver)
- TR: 66.9% (+26.8pp) — gpt-4o K=5, new temporal prompt (CONFOUNDED — cannot separate)
- KU: 66.7% (+2.8pp) — gpt-4o K=1
- SSA: 92.9% (0pp) — gpt-4o-mini, ceiling

**Adversarial gate verdict:** PROCEED TO E2a, then E5.
- Flag 1&2 (HIGH): TR/Pref gains are from new prompts in v3_routing.py, not isolatable to GPT-4o reader. Prompt confound must be resolved before paper attribution.
- Flag 3 (MEDIUM): gpt-4o-mini grades Pref (same reader+grader). Bounded risk — removing all Pref correct answers still gives 76.1%.
- Flag 4 (MEDIUM): Multi-session run, wrong reproduce_command. Data integrity confirmed.

**Decision: Run E2a (TR with gpt-4o-mini + v3 prompts) to isolate prompt effect.**
**Rationale:** The system as a whole hits 75.5%. But the paper attribution between prompt improvement and model improvement is unresolved. E2a costs ~$2 and answers: if gpt-4o-mini + v3 prompts gets TR to 66%+, the new prompt is the lever (cheaper, publishable finding). If TR drops back to ~40%, GPT-4o is genuinely needed.

**E2a config:**
- qtypes: temporal-reasoning only
- reader: gpt-4o-mini (explicitly -- no gpt4o-for-multi)
- prompts: v3_routing.py defaults (same as E2 for TR = _QA_SYS_TEMPORAL)
- K=5 for TR
- max_tokens: 512
- out-dir: experiments/E2a-tr-ablation

**E2a command:**
```
python3 bench/qa_eval_v3_routing.py \
  --run-id runP-v35 \
  --experiment-id E2a \
  --qtypes temporal-reasoning \
  --data-dir ~/Documents/projects/LongMemEval/data \
  --out-dir experiments/E2a-tr-ablation
```
(No --gpt4o-for-multi → gpt-4o-mini is used for TR by default)

## After E2a — TBD

## After E3 — TBD

## After E4 — TBD

## After E5 — TBD

## E2 Config Deviation from Prior Session Plan (2026-04-24)

**Prior plan (E1-decisions.md):** Run E2 with v3 synthesis prompts + GPT-4o to resolve Flag 5 (gameable regression).

**This session's decision:** Run E2 with v2 prompts + GPT-4o (isolate model upgrade effect cleanly).

**Rationale:** v2 prompts are the established baseline (67.8% MS at K=5). Using them in E2 means any improvement is unambiguously from the model, not a prompt interaction. If E2+v2 doesn't hit 75%, a v2b run (v3 prompts + GPT-4o) would test the prompt question separately with a full budget.

**Risk:** May leave performance on the table if GPT-4o + v3 prompts is materially better.
**Mitigation:** If E2 < 75%, run E2b with v3 prompts.
